Explore Earth's climate's energy budget.

This ReactJS app provides an overview of Earth's climate systems, including albedo and the greenhouse effect.
Users can dynamically adjust parameters and observe the corresponding changes to Earth's Global Mean Surface Temperature
(GMST), gaining insights into the interactions that shape our climate.

My understanding of this basic climate model is from the Open
University's [OpenLearn Climate Change](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/nature-environment/climate-change/) course. The
infographic is inspired from course materials.
