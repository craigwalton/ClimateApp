# Climate App

## Introduction

An interactive infographic implemented as a React app which provides an overview of the global energy budget from an
Earth climate perspective. It aims to help a user understand the systems which affect the Earth's climate including the
greenhouse effect and how they interact by allowing them to see the effects of changing the values of the various
parameters.

My understanding of this basic climate model is from the Open
University's [OpenLearn Climate Change](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/nature-environment/climate-change/) course. The
infographic is inspired from course materials.

## Development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run deploy`
