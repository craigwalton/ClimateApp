An interactive infographic implemented as a ReactJS app which provides an overview of the global energy budget from an
Earth climate perspective.

It aims to help the user understand the systems which affect the Earth's climate including the greenhouse effect and how
they interact by allowing the user change values of various parameters and see the resulting changes.

My understanding of this basic climate model is from the Open University's [OpenLearn Climate Change](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/nature-environment/climate-change/) course. The
infographic is inspired from course materials.
